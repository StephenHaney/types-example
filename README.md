Hello! I created a repo with my example from this thread: https://github.com/DefinitelyTyped/DefinitelyTyped/issues/33015#issuecomment-465338989

This is a brand new TS Create React App, with nothing but styled-components installed. I just flipped "skipLibCheck" off to show the problem.

Try to run yarn run build... you'll get Duplicate Identifier from node_modules/@types/react-native/globals.d.ts.
